# Examples of multi-mesh deployments

This repository contains examples of Istio
[multi-mesh deployments](https://preliminary.istio.io/docs/concepts/deployment-models/#multiple-meshes).
While the goal is to automate the examples and there is an effort under way to implement the automation, these examples
can be useful to automation-tool writers and to early adopters who want to experiment with
[mesh-federation](https://preliminary.istio.io/docs/reference/glossary/#mesh-federation).
